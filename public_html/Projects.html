        <h3>Portfolio1</h3>
        <p>In this project we were taught how to code HTML and CSS.<br />
           In Portfolio 1 we created an About Me page, a Technology Page, and<br /><!--Paragraph-->
           the Projects Page. In this Project I learned the basics of coding a website with HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h3>Portfolio2</h3>
        <p>In this project we used HTML,CSS, and Bootstrap. In this project we did<br />
           the same in adding an index page, project page, and technology page. In this<br />
           project we used a new thing called bootstrap. Bootstrap helps with the designing<br />
           of the website.
